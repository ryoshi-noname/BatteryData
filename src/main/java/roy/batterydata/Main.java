  /* This class will call the other classes and control the GUI window

  1) It will create a main window 1080X640
  2) It will call the File Chooser class to display a file chooser button
  3) It will call the ChartData class to obtain and store data from the chosen files
  4) It will call the DataViewer class to display the data from multiple files

  Currently, the DataViewer.java class and the FileChooserGUI.java class run as desired
  but they will need to be modified so that they are callable Classes,
  similar to the ChartData class.
